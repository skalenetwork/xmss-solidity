# EIP drafts

> **Moved here from FermionWallet.** These drafts, the contracts they were checked against and
> `check_eips.py` moved to this repository from
> [FermionWallet](https://github.com/skalenetwork/fermionwallet), which replaced XMSS with
> hybrid ECDSA + ML-DSA in v2. The XMSS stack is maintained here as a reference
> implementation. "The repository's specifications" below are now
> [`reference/docs/quantum-key-registry.md`](../docs/quantum-key-registry.md) and
> [`reference/docs/pre-approval-engine.md`](../docs/pre-approval-engine.md); the FermionGuard
> specifications and the Guard contract stay in FermionWallet, last as described here at
> [b03aa8f](https://github.com/skalenetwork/fermionwallet/tree/b03aa8f0d342e588a67aba20d137c7ef0d4579c8), and `check_eips.py` no longer
> checks the pre-approval draft against `FermionGuard.sol`.

The FermionGuard specifications, restated as standards: normative, implementation-independent,
and in the shape `ethereum/ERCs` expects. Three drafts, one per layer, each standing on its own:

| draft | layer | what it standardises |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`ERCS/erc-draft-xmss-verification.md`](ERCS/erc-draft-xmss-verification.md) | cryptography | the ABI encoding of RFC 8391 XMSS keys and signatures, the exact hash instantiation, the domain checks, and the leaf-index accounting any authority-granting caller owes |
| [`ERCS/erc-draft-hash-based-key-registry.md`](ERCS/erc-draft-hash-based-key-registry.md) | key lifecycle | registration, rotation and time-locked revocation of a device-held one-time-signature key for a smart account, as a complete state machine |
| [`ERCS/erc-draft-hybrid-pre-approvals.md`](ERCS/erc-draft-hybrid-pre-approvals.md) | authorisation | authorisations carrying one classical and one post-quantum signature over one EIP-712 digest, matched and consumed atomically at execution |

They compose upwards, and they do it in normative text: `[KR-09]` and `[KR-12]` of the registry
draft cite `[XV-19]`–`[XV-24]` of the verification draft, and `[PA-15]`, `[PA-17]` and `[PA-34]`
of the pre-approval draft cite `[KR-06]`, `[KR-30]`–`[KR-32]` and `[KR-40]`. Those are MUSTs
whose content lives in a sibling document, so the three are **not independently implementable
and must be submitted together**: only the verification draft stands alone. Once numbers exist,
each cross-citation becomes an `[ERC-N](./eip-N.md)` link and each sibling goes into `requires:`.
The drafts are CC0 ([`LICENSE.md`](LICENSE.md)); the code they describe is MIT ([`LICENSE`](../../LICENSE)).

## What came from where

| repository specification | became |
| --- | --- |
| [`reference/docs/quantum-key-registry.md`](../docs/quantum-key-registry.md), [`reference/src/QuantumKeyRegistry.sol`](../src/QuantumKeyRegistry.sol), [`reference/test/registry-proof/RegistrySpec.sol`](../test/registry-proof/RegistrySpec.sol) | the registry draft (§5 is the specification's transition table; the draft's Test Cases section says which of its rows are proved and which are not — `rotate`'s post-state is not) |
| [`reference/docs/pre-approval-engine.md`](../docs/pre-approval-engine.md), [`reference/src/PreApprovalEngine.sol`](../src/PreApprovalEngine.sol) | the pre-approval draft |
| [`src/XMSS.sol`](../../src/XMSS.sol), [`test/proof/RFC8391.sol`](../../test/proof/RFC8391.sol), [`reference/src/XmssVerifier.sol`](../src/XmssVerifier.sol) | the verification draft |
| FermionWallet's [`fermionguard-module.md`](https://github.com/skalenetwork/fermionwallet/blob/b03aa8f0d342e588a67aba20d137c7ef0d4579c8/fermionguard-module.md) and [`FermionGuard.sol`](https://github.com/skalenetwork/fermionwallet/blob/b03aa8f0d342e588a67aba20d137c7ef0d4579c8/contracts/src/FermionGuard.sol) | the pre-approval draft's §10 (informative) and its Security Considerations |

### What is deliberately not in the drafts

An ERC's Specification has to be something a second implementer can satisfy. These parts of the
repository's specifications are product decisions, not candidates for a standard, and forcing
them into normative text would only bind implementers to one deployment's choices:

- the Safe guard mechanics — `checkTransaction`/`checkModuleTransaction` ordering, the
  `ITransactionGuard`/`IModuleGuard` pair at one address, Safe storage-slot reads,
  `getTransactionHash` recomputation, Safe version detection. Safe is a third-party account
  implementation; the *requirements* an enforcement hook must meet are stated (pre-approval
  draft §10 and Security Considerations), the mechanism is left to the implementation;
- the hardcoded selector deny-list, the per-account selector permit-list, the pinned
  `MultiSendCallOnly` address, the batch-leg limits, the per-account pause and its anti-veto
  cooldown, the emergency de-guard delay. Each is a policy this deployment chose; the standard
  states only the properties that make such policies sound (an immutable timelock, a
  key-independent detach path that is strictly slower than the co-signed one);
- the off-chain parts: the Ledger application's screens and APDU interface, the Safe App UI,
  the relayer and the indexer, the hardware-security policy, the release process;
- the threat model and the deployment guides, which argue *why* the rules are what they are. The
  drafts carry that argument in their Rationale and Security Considerations sections instead,
  which is where EIP readers look for it.

## Submitting

The drafts are complete except for what only the EIP process can assign. To submit:

1. **Open a discussion thread** for each draft on `ethereum-magicians.org` and put its URL in
   `discussions-to:`. A Draft without one fails the editors' lint.
2. **Fork `ethereum/ERCs`**, copy each file to `ERCS/erc-<PR number>.md` — the convention is to
   use the pull-request number as the ERC number — and replace `eip: <to be assigned>` with that
   number. Rename `assets/erc-draft-xmss-verification/` to `assets/erc-<number>/` and update the
   asset link in the Test Cases section.
3. **Resolve the cross-references.** Each draft refers to its siblings by name ("the companion
   ERC on …") because no numbers exist yet. Once the numbers are assigned, replace those phrases
   with `[ERC-N](./eip-N.md)` links and add the numbers to `requires:`. The `[XV-nn]`, `[KR-nn]`
   and `[PA-nn]` labels are stable and can be cited across drafts as they are.

   The links the drafts already carry to published proposals — `[ERC-165](./eip-165.md)`,
   `[EIP-712](./eip-712.md)` and so on — are the form `ethereum/ERCs` uses: the display text is
   `ERC-N` or `EIP-N`, the target is always `eip-N.md`, and `eipw`'s `markdown-link-first`
   requires the *first* prose mention of each proposal to be one. They resolve only once the
   file sits in `ERCS/` next to the rest of the corpus, so nothing in this repository can
   follow them; `check_eips.py` checks their shape and deliberately does not look for them on
   disk.
4. **Lint.** The editors' linter is `eipw`, configured by
   `config/eipw.toml` in `ethereum/ERCs`:
   ```sh
   cargo install eipw          # needs a Rust toolchain
   eipw reference/eips/ERCS/*.md
   ```
   It is not run in this repository's CI (no Rust toolchain in the contracts job).
   `check_eips.py` below reimplements the subset of `eipw` that is pure pattern matching —
   preamble keys, order and lengths, section set and order, the RFC 2119 paragraph, the
   `Copyright` line, the absolute-link allowlist, `markdown-link-first`, the `EIP-N`/`ERC-N`
   spelling, proposal references in backticks, smart quotes — and adds fidelity checks `eipw`
   cannot make. It does **not** reimplement the rest, so run `eipw` before submitting: in
   particular `preamble-uint` on `eip`, `preamble-file-name`, `preamble-url` and the
   Ethereum Magicians regex on `discussions-to`, `markdown-link-status` and
   `preamble-requires-status` (which need the merged EIP/ERC corpus), `markdown-json-schema`
   and `markdown-html-comments`. Expect `eipw` to complain about `eip: <to be assigned>` and
   the placeholder `discussions-to:` until step 1 and step 2 are done — those two are the
   point of the placeholders.
5. **Expect the Specification to be questioned, not the Rationale.** The clauses most likely to
   draw review are `[XV-20]` (leaf records keyed by the public root), `[XV-24]` (the tree height
   comes from the registration, not the signature), `[KR-24]` (only the account may cancel a
   revocation) and `[PA-37]` (a single owner may not revoke an `ADMIN` approval). Each is
   load-bearing; each has its argument in the Rationale and a failure story in Security
   Considerations.

## Checks

```sh
python3 reference/eips/check_eips.py
```

It enforces, for each draft:

- the EIP-1 preamble — required keys, their order, `title` ≤ 44 characters, `description` ≤ 140,
  the `author` forms EIP-1 lists (including `Name <email>` and multi-author lists, with at least
  one GitHub handle), `status`/`type`/`category`, an ISO `created` date, ascending `requires`;
- the required sections, in EIP-1's order, EIP-1's exact RFC 2119/8174 paragraph — the one that
  includes `NOT RECOMMENDED` — and the exact `Copyright` line;
- the `eipw` body lints that are pure pattern matching: `markdown-link-first`, the `EIP-N`
  spelling, no proposal reference inside backticks, no smart quotes. These skip fenced blocks
  and code spans, as `eipw`'s own visitors do;
- links: relative ones must resolve on disk, except `eip-N.md`/`erc-N.md` proposal references,
  which are checked for shape; absolute ones must match `eipw`'s `markdown-relative-links`
  exception list, which does **not** include ethereum.org, eips.ethereum.org or
  ethereum-magicians.org;
- **fidelity to the code**: every error and event declaration, every EIP-712 type string, the
  function signatures of the interfaces, and the named constants quoted in a draft must exist,
  byte for byte, in the Solidity the draft claims to describe;
- **the published test vector, executed.** `assets/erc-draft-xmss-verification/` is run, not
  merely linked: its key material must still be the library's own `h = 10` vector, its `reject`
  case must differ from the genuine one in exactly one bit, and every case's verdict is checked
  by verifying it with the library's independent Python transcription of RFC 8391
  (`py/xmss_ref.py`).

The last two groups are the ones that matter over time. A specification and its implementation
drift silently, and an asset nothing runs drifts fastest of all; a failing test says so.
`check_eips.py` runs in CI next to the contract tests (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

What it still does not check, and a reviewer will: return types and mutability of the quoted
interfaces, struct field types and order, enum ordinals, the identity and commitment formulas
(`quantumKeyId`, `preApprovalId`, the Tier-2 commitment), and the XMSS draft's ADRS table and
base-`w` digit formulas. Those are prose and tables, not declarations, so they are pinned by
the drafts' own Test Cases sections and by the contracts' tests rather than by this script.

## Mapping to the repository's requirement index

The repository's specifications carry requirement IDs (`[GRD-nnn]`, `[ENG-nnn]`, `[QKR-nnn]`)
that the contracts' tests cite. The drafts carry their own (`[XV-nn]`, `[KR-nn]`, `[PA-nn]`),
because a standard's clause numbering cannot depend on one repository's document structure.
Document-level correspondence is the table above. The clause-level map is worth writing once the
repository's requirement index settles; the single entry worth recording now, because it is the
security bug this work found rather than a restatement:

| draft clause | repository requirement | what it says |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[XV-20]`, `[KR-12]` | `[QKR-009a]` | the consumed-leaf record is keyed by the XMSS root, never by a per-registration identifier — one physical key registered by two accounts must share one leaf record |
