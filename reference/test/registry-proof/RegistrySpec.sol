/// @title QuantumKeyRegistry — executable specification of the key state machine
/// @notice The rules of `reference/docs/quantum-key-registry.md` written as plain code: at most one
///         Active key per Safe, a per-key status that tells a Rotated key from a
///         Revoked one, sticky enrollment, one-shot roots, a per-Safe ceremony nonce
///         consumed by every owner-signed action, and an emergency revocation behind
///         a time lock that only the Safe can cancel and that a rotation supersedes.
///         `RegistryEquivalence.t.sol` proves `QuantumKeyRegistry` makes exactly these
///         state transitions, for all inputs, with Halmos.
///
///         Scope: the state machine over the six fields of `SafeState`. Each lemma
///         installs an ARBITRARY such state (the harness's `primeState`) that satisfies
///         `invariant` and then runs one transition, so the proofs range over the whole
///         abstract state space rather than over whatever a genesis-to-here call
///         sequence happens to reach, and every successful transition is proven to
///         preserve `invariant` again. The all-zero genesis state satisfies it, so
///         induction covers every reachable state.
///
///         Assuming `invariant` is what makes the transition lemmas tractable, and it
///         is also what would make the `activeKeyStatus == Status.Active` clauses below
///         vacuous, since the invariant already rules out a non-Active key sitting in
///         `activeKeyId`. `check_activeKeyStatusIsEnforced` is the one lemma that does
///         NOT assume the invariant: it installs that broken state on purpose and proves
///         the registry still refuses to rotate, request or cancel from it. Read those
///         clauses as proven by that lemma, not by the ones that assume them away.
///
///         Deliberately abstracted, and why:
///         - Owner-threshold signatures and the Ledger attestation: the `PermissiveSafe`
///           and `PermissiveSigner` stubs in `RegistryEquivalence.t.sol` accept every
///           signature, so the lemmas say what the registry does GIVEN that both
///           authorizations succeeded. See `README.md` in this directory.
///         - The Guard's enrollment posture check ([QKR-006]: a fallback handler or
///           unguarded enabled modules) lives in `FermionGuard._afterEnrollment`, not
///           here. It is NOT silently missing: it enters this specification as the
///           `postureOk` parameter of `canRegister`, and the harness's hook refuses
///           whenever it is false — so the proof does cover that a hook refusal vetoes
///           the whole registration atomically. What the posture check itself *is*
///           belongs to the Guard's own proof, not to the registry's.
///         - XMSS verification. `rotateQuantumKey` consumes one leaf of the old key as
///           a possession proof, and a valid XMSS signature is out of reach inside the
///           symbolic model: Halmos treats SHA-256 as an uninterpreted function even on
///           concrete input, so the 67 WOTS+ chain lengths stay symbolic and the chains
///           fork (`PROOF.md` at the repository root: at h = 2 with a symbolic message the
///           solver did not finish in 40 minutes). `canRotate` therefore states the
///           preconditions that are about registry STATE, and `check_rotate` proves the
///           registry reaches the possession proof exactly when they hold. The effects
///           of a SUCCEEDING rotation — `afterRotate`, and the old key turning Rotated —
///           are unreachable for Halmos and are covered by the concrete-vector Foundry
///           tests in FermionWallet instead (`GuardIntegration.t.sol`, `DocExamples.t.sol`), so
///           `invariant` preservation across `Rotate` is assumed, not proven.
///         - Used-leaf accounting (the per-root bitmap) is not a `SafeState` field, so
///           "the rotation leaf is unused" is outside `canRotate` as well.
///
///         Note for callers: every `after*` function writes the transition's effects
///         THROUGH its `SafeState memory` argument (that is how Solidity passes memory
///         structs) and returns the same struct. Never hand one a pre-state you still
///         need afterwards — see `_scratch` in `RegistryEquivalence.t.sol`.
